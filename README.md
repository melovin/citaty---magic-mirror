# MAGIC MIRROR
### > PARTS
  * Raspberry PI ZERO
  * Old TV
  * SD card with Raspbian (in project folder)
  > PS: When I was almost done, I accidentally broke the SD card with the os :) I had no idea where the problem was, so I bought a new raspberry PI because of it. At least now I have an extra raspberry PI for my next project :)
